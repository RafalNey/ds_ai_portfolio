## **About Me**

<div class="centered-content" markdown="1">
My professional life is a rather colorful mosaic. Iâ€™ve been a marketing specialist, a company director, a chef, and even a casino detective catching cheaters. Each of these experiences taught me something newâ€”something I could later draw upon. For instance, my time as an editor at a publishing house eventually led me to write a book and a collection of childrenâ€™s stories, with my daughters as my first readers and harshest critics.

I enjoy a challenge. Thatâ€™s why, as a history teacher, I always aimed to make my lessons engaging and exciting. It paid offâ€”students appreciated it so much they once voted me the best teacher in school. Of course, like everyone, Iâ€™ve had my ups and downs. One of them ended with my business going bankrupt and a decade-long move to the UK in search of better opportunities.

Why did artificial intelligence fascinate me? I suppose itâ€™s because Iâ€™m a seeker. I try to stay open to adventure, ready for whatever might be waiting just around the corner. And what could be more intriguing than a journey into the unknownâ€”a dive into someone else's mind or an encounter with an alien civilization? In a way, I believe AI is all of these things combined. ðŸ™‚
